## TMDb-analysis

This repository contains my first project submission for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree course. In this project, I will be analyzing the tmdb dataset and 
communicating my findings using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib

### Research Questions include:
- Which genres are most popular from year to year?
- Has the number of movies produced annually since 2000 increased?
- Which directors produced the most movies?
- Does the length of a movie affect its rating?
- Is a higher budget associated with a higher revenue?
- Which genres were produced the most and which were the most popular?
- Which were the top 10 most successfull movies of all time?

### Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
